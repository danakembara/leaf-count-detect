## Introduction
Plant phenotype is a set of observable characteristics resulting from interactions between gene expression and the environment. Accurate and efficient monitoring of plant phenotype is essential for intelligent production in plant cultivation, which leads to better decision-making resulting in a higher yield. Traditional plant monitoring still uses manual measurement to analyze phenotypes, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and biased toward the observer.
